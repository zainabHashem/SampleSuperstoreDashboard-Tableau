        The top-left pie chart shows product-wise sales and their contribution to total sales.
        The bottom-left pie chart visualizes sales by region, with each segment representing a different region (Central, East, South, West).

    Product Sales and Profit Bar Chart:
        This horizontal bar chart displays sales and profit margins for different products, helping to identify top performers.

    Category-wise Sales vs. Profit Bar Chart:
